# Radhe Travels ✈️

A simple, multi-page static website project created using pure HTML. This project serves as a website for "Radhe Travels," featuring a main landing page to showcase beautiful travel destinations across India and a dedicated page for contact information.

## ✨ Project Overview

1.  **Homepage (`Travelwebsite.html`)**: An introduction to the travel agency, featuring tour packages, top destinations, and travel tips.
2.  **Contact Page (`Contact.html`)**: A page providing multiple ways to get in touch with the travel advisors, including phone, email, and a physical address.

It is built entirely with **HTML5** and demonstrates the use of various semantic tags, lists, tables, and inter-page navigation.

## 📂 File Structure

The project uses the following file structure for all assets and pages to link correctly:

```
